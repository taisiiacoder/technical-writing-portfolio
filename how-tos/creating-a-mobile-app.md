This section will cover the process of creating a mobile application for your online store using the DCode Mobile service.

> **Notes:** The mobile application can be created by users who already have an online store on the DCode platform in the form of a boxed license or a cloud account.

To create a mobile application, you need to go to the section of your personal account **My mobile applications** and click on the **Add mobile application** button.

On the next page, you need to select the site with which you plan to integrate, as well as read the terms of the license agreement and accept them.

DCode will prompt you to select a site from a list of verified licenses and your cloud accounts.

> **Notes:** If you don't find your site in the list, check if your license is available in the **My Account -> Activated Licenses** section. If you do not find the license in the list of activated licenses, please contact support.

If your site uses the HTTPS protocol, select it as a priority. This will increase the security of data exchange between the application and your site.

The **site folder** field should be filled in only if you installed your online store physically not in the root folder of the site, respectively, this is reflected in the URL, for example: **example.com/shop/**. In this case, you need to specify the **shop** folder in the field . If the site is located in the root folder, then this field should be left empty.

After selecting a site, DCode will attempt to retrieve the multisites available in your online store. Select the multisite for which you want to create an app and click the **Create** button.

The application will be added to your personal account, then you can start filling in the rest of the information.

# Testing your online store

Next, you need to test the store for compliance with all the requirements necessary for its integration with the mobile application. To start testing, click on the **Test** button.

![app_test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50182933/214884412-887ca092-44b9-4bf1-b5a5-90977965a255.jpg)

If errors are found during testing, information about them will be displayed in the table. If the error persists, please contact support.

> **Notes:** The mobile app will only work correctly with the latest version of the DCode platform. Make sure your online store is up to date.

If the testing is successful, instead of the "<b>Test</b>" button, you will see the "<b>Fill in data</b>" button. You must click on it to proceed to the procedure for filling in the application data.

Step 2: Information to post
---------------------------

In the second step, you need to fill in the fields that we will need to publish the application in the AppStore and GooglePlay, as well as select the services that you want to order.

The DCode Mobile service offers a choice of 2 publishing options:

**1.  Publishing from DCode accounts in AppStore and GooglePlay.** If you choose this option, we will publish your application from our AppStore and GooglePlay accounts. You save time signing up for accounts, and you save $125/year on developer program fees. In the column "application author" our name will be indicated. In this case, we do not provide access to the AppStore and GooglePlay accounts. Recommended for small companies.
**2.  Publishing from your own AppleStore and GooglePlay accounts.** Select this option if you would like to have a signature attached to the application with your company name. In this case, your company will need to purchase and annually renew membership in the developer program on the AppStore and GooglePlay. You will have full access to the developer's account in the AppStore and GooglePlay. Recommended for medium and large companies.

Below are 3 services that DCode Mobile offers to get you started quickly:

**1.  Application publishing service** - a basic service that includes generating the necessary certificates and all the necessary screenshots, building and uploading the application to the GooglePlay and AppStore application catalogs, and corresponding with the moderators of these services in case of questions about the application. We will also register a Firebase Cloud Messaging account for you to receive in-app push notifications as part of this service.

> **Notes:** Paying for this service automatically creates a support ticket within which the manager servicing your application will inform you about the progress of creating the application, and, if necessary, request additional information.

**2.  Account registration service in GooglePlay and AppStore**

    **The service is available only if you have chosen to publish on behalf of your accounts.** If you do not want to research the features of registration on these sites, you can entrust it to DCode. We will register an email box for you at @gmail.com, and then, on behalf of this box, we will register accounts for your company in Apple and Google services.

    To publish applications from your accounts, you will need to pay for participation in the Developer Program, it costs $25 at [Google](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6112435?hl=en) and $99 at [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships/) (check with the relevant services for the current amounts). The indicated amounts must be paid by the client directly to these services. We will provide instructions inside the ticket.

    If you already have accounts in the AppStore and GooglePlay or you want to register them yourself, you can specify access (login, password) to them in the appropriate fields below.

**3.  Mobile application icon and splash screen development service**

    Choose this service if you want our professional designers to prepare all the necessary graphic materials for publishing a mobile application, namely an application icon and a splash image. When marking this service, you must describe a small task in any form, which should reflect what you would like to see on the icon and splash screen and, if possible, attach links to materials where your corporate identity is used or described.

    As soon as the images are ready, we will upload them to your personal account. You can always download them in full size, if necessary.

    If you already have images or have your in-house designer, you can upload your icon and splash screen for your mobile application.

After filling in all the fields, click on the "save" button to proceed to the next step.

Step 3. Visual design
---------------------

At this step, you can customize the colors of the main elements used in the mobile application, as well as upload your splash image if you did not select the splash screen design service in the previous step.

![app_step_3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50182933/214885676-c4919adb-4d35-49e5-99b2-7340acbc52ec.jpg)

Step 4. Finish
--------------

In this step, summary information on the selected services and the "Proceed to payment" button will be displayed. Payment for services will mean the start of work on assembling a mobile application for your online store.

Immediately after payment, the status of your mobile application will be changed to "Pending review". The RDCode manager will check the correctness of filling in the information and either transfer the application to the status "Data correction required" or to the status "Awaiting publication".

As soon as the development of images and registration of accounts is completed (if these services have been ordered) and all the necessary information is filled in on your part, DCode specialists will start building and publishing the application on GooglePlay and the AppStore. Upon completion of the publication, links to applications will be published in the application card in your personal account on the DCode.com website.

# Viewing and editing a mobile application

After publishing the application, you will be able to view basic information about the mobile application, as well as change some application settings. Let's talk about the most important information that will be available to you on the "Information" tab:

![app_show_info](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50182933/214885903-eef3819b-6af0-4f00-a614-80c78320f0bf.jpg)

-   **Compilation Status** - Displays the status of the technical process that is currently happening with your application. For example, there may be statuses here: Not yet created, in the build queue (build), in the update queue (deploy), in processing, an update is ready, and the application has been created. As soon as you make changes to the application (for example, a change in the color scheme) that require it to be delivered to the mobile application, the compilation status will reflect the progress of what is happening inside the system.
-   **Task in Helpdesk** - a link to a task within which you can conduct a dialogue with a DCode mobile application specialist.

-   **Protocol** - specifies the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) that will be used for data exchange between the mobile application and the online store.
-   **API key** - API key required to exchange data via API.
-   **SplashScreen (splash screen)** - splash screen displayed during application loading.
-   **Color scheme** - colors in which various elements of the application are decorated.

Payment for a subscription to a mobile application will be available only after the application has been successfully published in AppleStore or GooglePlay. Within 14 days the application will work without a paid subscription.
