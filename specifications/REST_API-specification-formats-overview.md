# Overview of REST API specification formats

REST APIs follow an architectural style, not a specific standard. However, several REST specifications have been developed to represent the standards as a description of the REST API. The three most popular REST API specifications are [OpenAPI (formally called Swagger)](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification), [RAML](https://raml.org/), and [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/).

In the early years of the specifications, there was healthy competition between the formats. But now, without a doubt, the OpenAPI specification is the most popular, with the largest community, dynamics, and various tools.

> **Note**:`OpenAPI`refers to the specification, and `Swagger`refers to API tools that read and display information in the specification. A detailed story about OpenAPI and Swagger in the following sections.

In general, REST API specifications lead to improved documentation structure. Take into account that these REST API specifications mainly describe the reference [endpoints in the API](https://starkovden.github.io/about-third-module.html). While these sections are essential, other documentation is needed beyond them.

However, the documentation that a specification covers is often the core value of an API as it deals with endpoints and their responses.

The spec entry introduces a new dimension to the documentation that makes API documentation inherently unique. By mastering the format of the OpenAPI specification, you can improve your technical writer skills.
