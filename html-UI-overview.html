<h2>Overview of Swagger UI</h2>
<p>Swagger UI is one of the most popular tools for creating interactive documentation. Swagger UI creates an interactive
  API console for experimenting with real-time requests. In addition, Swagger UI (an actively <a
    href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">managed project</a> with an Apache 2.0 license) supports the latest
  version of the OpenAPI specification (3.x) and integrates with other Swagger tools.</p>
<p>Before we dive into Swagger, we need to clarify some key terms.</p>
<h3>Swagger</h3>
<p>Refers to the API tools associated with the OpenAPI specification. Some of these tools are <a

    Tools</a>&nbsp;for more information.&nbsp;"Swagger" was originally the original name of the OpenAPI specification,
  but the name was later changed to OpenAPI to reinforce the open, non-licensed nature of the standard. People sometimes
  refer to both names interchangeably (especially on older web pages), but "OpenAPI" is how the spec should be referred
  to. For more information on the difference between OpenAPI and Swagger, see <a

    between Swagger and OpenAPI?&raquo;</a>.</p>
<h3>OpenAPI</h3>
<p>The official name of the OpenAPI specification. The OpenAPI specification provides a set of properties that can be
  used to describe a REST API. A working, valid document can be used to create interactive documentation, build client
  SDKs, run unit tests, and more. Details of the specification can be found on GitHub at <a
    href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification</a>. As part of the
  Open API initiative with the Linux Foundation, the OpenAPI specification aims to be vendor-independent (many companies
  are involved in its development).</p>
<h3>Swagger Editor</h3>
<p><a href="http://editor.swagger.io/#/">An online editor</a>&nbsp;that checks the OpenAPI documentation against the
  rules of the OpenAPI specification. The Swagger editor flags errors and provides formatting advice.</p>
<h3>Swagger UI</h3>
<p>A web framework (<a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">on GitHub</a>) that parses a document into an
  OpenAPI specification and creates an interactive documentation web page. Swagger UI is a tool that turns a spec into
  a&nbsp;<a href="http://petstore.swagger.io/">Petstore-like site</a>.</p>
