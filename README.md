# Technical Writing Portfolio
In my tech writer portfolio, you can find some examples of my open-access works. The repository includes `Markdown` docs and some sample files in other languages to demonstrate  `XML` rendering with `HTML` and `JavaScript`.

Also, in the the repository history you will find different examples of editting. These include **initial commits**, adding edited files via upload, and creating branches for further **pull requests**.

Thank you for your attention to my profile. Enjoy reading the documentation!
