# Personal data processing policy (FZ-152)

To fulfill obligations to supply goods and provide services, any online store is forced to request personal data from buyers. The Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. § 552a) protects personal information held by the federal government by preventing unauthorized disclosures of such information. Individuals also have the right to review such information, request corrections, and be informed of any disclosures. 

A company processing personal data must adopt an internal document "Personal Data Processing Policy" and publish it for public access. And before buying, each buyer is obliged to consent to the processing of personal data.

Thus, 2 documents should be published on the site: "Personal data processing policy", "Consent to the processing of personal data", and before each button, clicking on which causes the transfer of personal data, an inscription with the following content should be displayed: "By clicking on the button, I consent to the processing of personal data".

DCode helps the owner of an online store to bring his store in line with the law. In the section **Website → Site settings → "Personal data" tab,** it is possible to specify the text of two documents. You can also download the standard text of 2 documents.

The personal data processing policy will be available on your website at the link **DCode-Store.com/policy/** . You can place a link to this section in any suitable place on your site. For example, to do this, you can create a menu item in the section **Website → Menu**. For this menu item, select the **Link** type and specify the link: **/policy/**.

When you check the box "Enable displaying the agreement on the processing of personal data in forms", on the pages of registration, ordering, feedback forms, the corresponding inscription with a link to the agreement (/policy-agreement/) will be displayed.
